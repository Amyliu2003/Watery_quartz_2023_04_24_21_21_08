So I want you to help me to recognize some sentence I say, so both you and I can learn about your own language a bit more. From now on, I will continously speak like this, but you will not get subtitiles anymore. Everytime after I speak a sentence, if you figure out what I was saying by repeating what I say, you win this level, and we will then move on to the next one. Now, please say 'discourse' again, thank you. ",
